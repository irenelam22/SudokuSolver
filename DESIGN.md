# TSE Querier Design Spec

Recall the [Querier Requirements Spec](REQUIREMENTS.md); the **querier** allows the user to search through the provided 
pageDirectory and index file to find keywords. The querier allows for special processing using "and" or "or" (with "and" 
have precedence). The querier will output the pages which contain the keywords (if applicable). Also, it will rank the 
pages based on how many times the word(s) appear in the given documents. 

A Design Spec should contain several sections:

* User interface
* Inputs and Outputs
* Functional decomposition into modules
* Pseudo code for logic/algorithmic flow
* Dataflow through modules
* Major data structures
* Testing plan

Let's look through each.
